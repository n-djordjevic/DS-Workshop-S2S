    "Since the dawn of time, a war has been raging between Python programmers and R programmers. Every time the war was coming to an end, a new battle surprised everyone. Today, you - the Chosen One - and me are going to try to stop this evil menace and bring balance to the Force.<br><br>\n",
    "Every person, like you and me, who wanted to start learning Data Science and Machine Learning could never have a clear way to the finish line. That being said, as soon as he/she wanted to start, the first problem arose: which programming language should I learn? R or Python?<br>\n",
    "R is better for statistical analysis which is why it was popular for this use case. Nonetheless, Python has a much bigger audience, a bigger community, is more flexible and easier to learn (being close to the English language). Python has a much wider variety of libraries used for Machine Learning, some of which we'll learn how to use here, like `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` and `sci-kit learn`. Not only that, we're going to learn how to use `Jupyter Notebook` as our programming environment. What's really useful, as you're about to see, these notebooks can have both text <b>and</b> code in them, making this the perfect platform for learning programming and Machine Learning. <br><br>\n",
